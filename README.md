# FNaF 2 PS1 Port Project

After [FNAF1PSX](https://github.com/Soeiz/FNaF-PS1-Project), I attempt to now port its sequel into the Playstation 1 !

By using ancient scrolls left by the ancestors ([nugget + psyq sdk](https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds)) I've made my way into playstation 1 programmation, and I developed this game, or this demake.

Because this demake is not something you have to play on PC with a .exe, you'll have to play it with an ps1 emulator, or the actual console !

If you want to play on real hardware, you'd have to modchip it, use the disc swap method or FreePSXBoot ! (google it)

The game has unique things that were not on the OG game, such as two player mode, Custom night with far more options, easter eggs, and more !

Unfortunately, there's no minigames in this port because of memory issues.
